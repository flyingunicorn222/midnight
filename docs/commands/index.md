# Commands

Commands are simply message that start with `/` when you send a message
starting by `/` the bot will receive the message and answer accordingly.

All the commands are being created organically based on user's needs, so
if you believe there is something missing [Get in Touch!](../misc/Contact.md)

You don't have to remember all the commands as you can easily see the list
of all available commands by typing [/help](../commands/help.md)
