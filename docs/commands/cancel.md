# /cancel

Will cancel open orders for a given market.

``` bash
/long eurusd 0.01 # open an order on eurusd
/cancel eurusd    # will cancel the order
```
Goes without saying this only work while you Order isn't filled, once the order
is filled you made a mistake you will need to close the Position instead.
