This command allows you to open LONG orders on the market.

There are only two parameters needed

 - margin - The amount of Bitcoin you will invest in this position.

```

If you don't specify those you will receive help for the `/long` command.

### Optional parameters

specify it using MAX to use maximun allowed leverage or HALF for half of
the allowed leverage or even QUARTER ( you know for how much! ).


``` bash

/long eurusd 0.01 half   Â # order will use 100X leverage
/long eurusd 0.01 quarter # order will use  50X leverage
```
