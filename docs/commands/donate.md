# /donate

Believe me or not this command didn't exist until a couple of users asked how
they could donate, needless to say it made us absolutely happy and guaranteed
a couple extra pizzas during our late hours.

Feel free to feel awesome and happy a starving Robot and a couple generous
nerds by [Donating](../misc/Contribute.md#donate) or [Contributing](misc/Contribute.md)
in any way!

All donations are and will be strictly used to improve the free bot and the
open source libraries unless strictly defined by donour - despite a few requests
we won't post nudes of our old school computer keyboards.
