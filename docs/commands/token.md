# /token

Used to update your API Token, for more in depth explanation on why we need
a token please check the "[Connect the bot](start/create_an_account.md#connect-the-bot)"
Page

``` bash
/token Dc7d8c7f23c2591084d645169a8d12b45
```

Surely enough this token won't work! You have to swap the complicated code
by the one found on Your [Access & API Management](https://1broker.com/trade/#access-management")
page.
