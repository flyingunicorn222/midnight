# Contribute

This bot was initially created to help a small group of friends to trade and
manage our orders anytime anywhere, hence why we give so much love to it, we
use it constantly, every day and we are always thinking how to improve it to
help us making better trades.

We learn a lot from the community and we love to give back and we do as much
as we can and we plan to do even more!

That's why we open sourced the node.js client we developed for [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=11468)

## Node.js Library

`1broker-client` is a node.js library available on github, [checkout our repository](github.com/flyingunicorn222/1broker-client)

You can contribute by adding more features to it, or just by help house
keeping by [creating issues](https://github.com/flyingunicorn222/1broker-client/issues/new)
and reviewing [code/documentation](https://github.com/flyingunicorn222/1broker-client/tree/v2/src).

Or getting directly into ninja work writing some [more tests](https://github.com/flyingunicorn222/1broker-client/blob/v2/test/index.coffee)!

## Donate

Needless to say we are investing a lot of time and care into this, the bot doesn't even sleep
 24 hours!
