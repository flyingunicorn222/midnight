# Getting Started

After downloading and installing [Telegram](http://t.me) on your favourite(s)
devices there is only two very short steps before you can have endless amount
of typing fun:

## Create an Account

In order to trade using [telebroker_bot](http://t.me/telebroker_bot) you will
first need to create an account on [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=11468)
website. The registration is quite simple, free and only take a few seconds.

Once your account is created you will be able to navigate the website, look
at market information, see other traders, check your account balance and much
more.

As you can see the website allow you to pretty much do anything you need to
manage your positions by clicking around on the interface just as everyone
is used to.

## Connect the bot

Now it's where the fun starts...

We will talk to our beloved bot so he will be able to assist us opening and
managing our trades and even notify us when important things happen.

Sounds cool? Then go ahead and start talking to the bot by [clicking here](http://t.me/telebroker_bot)
then launching Telegram.

Unfortunately the bot still doesn't have telepathic skills hence why we will
need to generate an API Token on [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=11468),
you can do by going to the website and clicking on [Access & API Management](https://1broker.com/trade/#access-management"),
scrolling down and then clicking on "**Generate API Token**"
