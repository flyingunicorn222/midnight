# Create an Account

In order to trade using [telebroker_bot](http://t.me/telebroker_bot) you will
first need to create an account on [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=11468)
website. The registration is quite simple, free and only take a few seconds.

Once your account is created you will be able to navigate the website, look
at market information, see other traders, check your account balance and much
more.

As you can see the site is fully featured and allow you to pretty much do
anything you need by clicking around on the interface, just as everybody
is used to.

But that's not all, the fun part is about to start.

We will talk to our beloved bot so he will be able to assist us by allowing us
to open and manage trades and even notify us regardless of us being checking
the website.

Sounds cool? Then go ahead and start talking to the bot by [clicking here](http://t.me/telebroker_bot)
