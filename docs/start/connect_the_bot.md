# Connect the bot

Now it's where the fun starts...

We will talk to our beloved bot so he will be able to assist us opening and
managing our trades and even notify us when important things happen.

Sounds cool? Then go ahead and start talking to the bot by [clicking here](http://t.me/telebroker_bot)
then launching Telegram.

Unfortunately the bot still doesn't have telepathic skills hence why we will
need to generate an API Token on [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=11468),
you can do by going to the website and clicking on [Access & API Management](https://1broker.com/trade/#access-management),
scrolling down and then clicking on "**Generate API Token**"

Once you have you generated your token you just have to send a message to the bot:

``` bash
/token YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

Once you done that you will be ready to trade and manage your account any time
through Telegram messages!
