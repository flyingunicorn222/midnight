# Group Chat

Not long ago we had a great idea, why not let the bot receive commands in a
group chat? Why not let users share their positions with their own group?

Basically this feature allows you to create a group chat with your friends
on Telegram and then add the bot as participant so everyone can manage
their own accounts and share their trades with their group friends.

In order to make your own group, simply create a group on Telegram and add
@telebroker_bot to it, you can also add your friends and your enemies !

This way you can trade and share your position in real time with your peers.

In case you create your own group, It's recommended to turn the group into a
supergroup, but that's up to you.

.... and that's not all!
