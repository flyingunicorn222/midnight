### Group Chat

You can also add [@telebroker_bot](http://t.me/telebroker_bot) to group chats
it will work pretty much the same as private messages but slightly changed to
fit in a group environment.

Messages that don't start with `/` are ignored by the bot, the others will
be read by the bot and if they are a command they will be executed.

For istance if you type in a room:

``` bash
/long eurusd 0.1
```

The bot will answer in front of everyone showing you are longing eurusd, later
on you can reveal your positions by typing:

``` bash
/positions
```

The bot will answer in front of everyone revealing your positions including
Stop Loss and Take Profit value
