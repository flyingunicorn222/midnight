# Group Chat

Not long ago we had a great idea, why not let the bot receive commands in a
group chat? Why not let users share their positions with their own group?

Basically this feature allows you to create a group chat with your friends
on Telegram and then add the bot as participant so everyone can manage
their own accounts and share their trades with their group friends.

and even better...
