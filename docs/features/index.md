# Features

We always try to come up with out of the box ideas, for instance we have been
providing Stop Loss and Take Profit to our users even before it was available
on the official 1Broker website.

If you have any funky idea, please [Get in Touch!][../misc/Contact.md]

## Notifications

Another thing we are very proud of is the fact we do notify our users once
a Position is Opened and once a Position is Closed, together with their
PnL.

This is extremely helpful when you are on the go, since Telegram will send you
a push notifcation ( which you can mute if you prefer ) allowing you to be in
the loop even when you are on the go.

It's very useful even if using a desktop/laptop computer as the notification
will pop on Telegram Desktop even if you have the website closed.

## Group Chat

Not long ago we had a great idea, why not let the bot receive commands in a
group chat? Why not let users share their positions with their own group?

Basically this feature allows you to create a group chat with your friends
on Telegram and then add the bot as participant so everyone can manage
their own accounts and share their trades with their group friends.

and even better...

## Trollbox

Why not create [The Official Unnoficial 1Broker Trollbox](http://t.me/Trollbox_1Broker)
and let all of us be ashamed of our buy-high-sell-low moves?

As much as we would love the room to be funny and trolling, unfortunately
it's still not there. People take trading and being friendly very seriously
over there, so make sure you come and help trolling some n00bs!
