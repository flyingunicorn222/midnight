# Notifications

Another thing we are very proud of is the fact we do notify our users once
a Position is Opened and once a Position is Closed, together with their
PnL.

This is extremely helpful when you are on the go, since Telegram will send you
a push notifcation ( which you can mute if you prefer ) allowing you to be in
the loop even when you are on the go.

It's very useful even if using a desktop/laptop computer as the notification
will pop on Telegram Desktop even if you have the website closed.
