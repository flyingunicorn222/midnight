### What is 1Broker?

If you are already familiar with [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=11468),
feel free to skip the following explanation. But for those of you who are new
to [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=11468), here's a quick intro:

[1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=11468) is an online broker which allows you
to trade many Stocks, Forex, Indexes, Commodities and BTC/USD using your Bitcoins.

For example, imagine you have 1BTC and you believe Apple shares will
rise in the following days, you could then go to [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=11468)
and "invest" 1BTC in Apple shares ( it's actually a [CFD](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp) ),
if Apple rises 10% you'll then be able to close your position for a 10% profit ( minus brokerage fees )

Another example, [1Broker.com](https://1broker.com/?r=11468) allows you to
leverage your trades, effectively multiplying the movement of the underlying
asset.

Imagine you buy 1BTC in Apple Shares with 2X Leverage, if Apple goes 10% up
you will effectively bank 20%, if apple share value drops by 5% then you will
loose 10%. Sounds complicated? I bet it doesn't!
